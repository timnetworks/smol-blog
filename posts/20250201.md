# Standard Issue Weblog Features

This is a regular paragraph with **bold text**, *italic text*, and __underlined text__. You can also use `inline code` within a paragraph.

## Headers

You can use different levels of headers:

### This is H3
#### This is H4
##### This is H5
###### This is H6

## Lists

Here's an unordered list:
* First item
* Second item
* Third item with **bold**
* Fourth item with *italics*

Here's an ordered list:
1. First numbered item
2. Second numbered item
3. Third numbered item with __underlining__
4. Fourth numbered item with `code`

## Code Blocks

Here's a code block with Python:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
    for i in range(5):
        print(f"Count: {i}")
```

And one with PHP:

```php
<?php
function greet($name) {
    echo "Hello, " . htmlspecialchars($name);
}
greet("World");
?>
```

## Blockquotes

Here's how blockquotes look:

> This is a blockquote. It can contain multiple lines
> and will be styled with a left border.
> You can use **bold** and *italic* here too.

## Images

You can include images like this (assuming they're in the right directory):

![Sample Image](images/sample.jpg)

## Multiple Paragraphs

This is the first paragraph.
It continues on this line because single line breaks are ignored.

This is a second paragraph because it's separated by a blank line.
See how the spacing works?

## Combining Elements

> Here's a blockquote that contains a list:
> * Item one
> * Item two
> * Item three

And finally, here's a paragraph with all inline elements: **bold**, *italic*, __underlined__, and `code` all in one place.
