# smol-blog
smolBlog - one simple php page and that's about it. *plus optional new post page*

## Features:

### Latest Posts Pagination
In sets of ten posts per page.
### Markdown Support
* Headers
* Bold text
* Italic text
* Underline text
* Paragraphs
* Lists
* Code Blocks
* Inline Code
* Blockquotes
* Images  
### Basic HTML Passthrough
You can do rudimentary code here without worries. Try not to break your own site.
### Daily posts
Single post per day. Any additional posts are appended to the same date.
### Single File
Single file runtime. *Optional second file for new posts.*

## Usage:

### Download
Downoad the file and drop it on your local (or remote) webserver. Create a folder named posts and drop your entries there in the format of **YYYYMMDD.md**. As long as you can parse PHP, and it's recent enough, it should work. If using the optional new post page, it'll create a directory and autoassign filenames based on date.
