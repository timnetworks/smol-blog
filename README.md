smolBlog - one simple php page and that's about it.

## Features:

### Pagination
In sets of ten posts per page.
### Markdown
* Headers
* Bold text (text)
* Italic text (text)
* Basic paragraphs
### Basic HTML Passthrough
Won't eat your img src links
### Single Page
Drag and drop elsewhere, no databases, no cloud accounts, no integration, not even a hidden preferences file.

## Usage:

### Download
Downoad the file and drop it on your local (or remote) webserver. As long as you can parse PHP, and it's recent enough, it should work.
