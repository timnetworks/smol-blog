### Download
Downoad the file and drop it on your local (or remote) webserver. Create a folder named posts and drop your entries there in the format of **YYYYMMDD.md**. As long as you can parse PHP, and it's recent enough, it should work. If using the optional new post page, it'll create a directory and autoassign filenames based on date.
